title: MacBook 2015 Revisited

  Since my last post, I dropped by an Apple Store to take a look at the
  2015 MacBook. It is difficult to overstate how startlingly small the
  new machine is in person. I may be biased by the internal
  specifications, but the impression is much more 'big tablet' than
  'small laptop'. The other standout feature was the touchpad. It
  continues Apple's tradition of high-quality touchpad implementations,
  removes the mechanicical switch and hinge, and adds force sensititivy
  and haptic feedback. The mechanical simplifications alone are a
  worthwhile improvement.

  I also spent some time typing on the keyboard. It's as shallow
  as you'd think, but the keys are very direct have a positive feel.
  There's none of the subtle rattling found on most small keyboards and
  it registered every keypress. I'm not completely convinced yet, but
  it at least seems possible that this type of keyboard could become the
  preferred keyboard for some typists.

  The performance of the machine is also a point of interest. Even the
  lightly loaded demo machine on the showroom floor had a few hiccups
  paging the display around from one virtual desktop to the next.
  Maybe it's nothing, but it does make me wonder if the machine can keep
  up with daily use, particuarly after a few OSX updates have been
  released. (For me, I think it'd be fine, but I spend most my time in
  Terminal, Emacs, and Safari, none of which are exactly heavy-hitters.)
