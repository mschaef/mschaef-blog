Believe it or not, Ryan turned six months old a couple weeks ago. It
does not seem all that long ago that Teresa and I got up from sitting
on the bathroom floor to look at the pregnancy test's two (!)
stripes. I remember very clearly that my first thought at the time
was, "Well, that's right!".  Six months after Ryan's birth that
thought is more true ever now, and this is despite the fact that there
is no way we could ever have been possibly been prepared for the
degree of impact Ryan has had on our lives. Ryan is truly a blessing,
and we are very fortunate to have him in our lives.

In honor of Ryan's first valentine's day, we've posted a few pictures
online of <a
href="http://www.mschaef.com/albums/ryan_valentines_day">the months
since Thanksgiving</a>.  What can I say other than that the last three
months have been very significant for our little one.  Among other
things, Ryan is now sitting up, eating multiple kinds of solid food,
actively playing with toys, and taking a distinct interest in petting
the dog (who is still a bit hesitant, since Ryan hasn't quite yet
mastered the distinction between 'pet' and 'grab').

We've also had some professional portraits taken, and a link to those
images is available <a

Be sure to enter 'Teresa Harrison' as the customer name.

One other note is that it's been close to two months since our last
significant post on the blog. A big part of the reason is work, but
another big part of the reason is that the posting workflow for this
blog is pretty much what it was <a
href="http://www.mschaef.com/blog/tech/this_blog/blosxom.txt">two
years ago</a>: ssh and a tty-based text editor. This is difficult for
both of us, so we've decided to move the Ryan-related content to <a
href="http://ryan-charles.blogspot.com/">another blog</a>.
