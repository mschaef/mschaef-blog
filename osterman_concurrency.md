<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/LarryOsterman">Larry Osterman</a> has
been running a nice <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/larryosterman/archive/2005/02/14/372508.aspx">
series of posts</a> on issues related to thread  synchronization and concurrency related issues.
It's been full of useful tips and tricks, I particularly like part 2,
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/larryosterman/archive/2005/02/15/373460.aspx">Avoiding
the Issue</a>. That's a technique that's worked well for me in the multithreaded
systems I've worked on. Of course, if you're writing SQL Server, etc. I'm sure
you can't take nearly as simple an approach.
