I'm hardly an authority on programming-related issues, but over the
years I've developed a small bag of tricks I use to make it easier to
quickly develop reliable (and debuggable/testable) software quickly.
This post is the beginning of a topic I'm going to use to describe
some of what works for me.

Most of what I'll be talking about is pretty obvious, I hope. I've
just seen enough people not do this stuff, that it's worth getting it
down in writing.
