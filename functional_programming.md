title: The world's most popular functional programming language...

This may be something of a suprise, but Excel has even gotten
the attention of <a href="http://research.microsoft.com">Microsoft
Research</a>.  Simon Peyton Jones, Margaret Burnett, and Alan Blackwell
have written a <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/Papers/excel/">
paper</a> that describes "extensions to the Excel spreadsheet that integrate 
user-defined functions into the spreadsheet grid". Of course, Excel
doesn't do this... but, I wonder if that should be "Excel doesn't do this
<b>yet</b>".

As a sidenote, this reminds me a little of how <a href="http://www.ni.com/labview">
LabView</a> handled subfunction definitions: subfunctions are defined
using the same visual tools as top-level functions.  It worked, but 'felt'
a little heavy weight in actual use.
