It never ceases to amaze me how much good material there is
online. Here's some more:

* <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~shivers/">Olin Shiver's</a>
   <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/thist.html">History of the T
   implemenatation of the Scheme programming language.</a>

* Aubrey Jaffer has some interesting material on interpreter
  performance issues at his <a
  href="http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/SCM.html">SCM</a> site.

* Alan Kay's <a href="http://gagne.homedns.org/~tgagne/contrib/EarlyHistoryST.html">
  Early History of Smalltalk</a>

* In 1994, Richard Stallman started a debate (flamewar?) on comp.lang.tcl with a post
  entitled
  <a href="http://gagne.homedns.org/~tgagne/contrib/EarlyHistoryST.html">
  Why you should not use Tcl</a>. The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html">Guile
  scripting language</a> was the logical outgrowth of this.

* <a href="http://www.nhplace.com/kent/">Kent Pitman</a> has posted a bunch of his writings
  relating to Lisp and SCheme. Among other things, he edited the
  <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm">Common Lisp
  Hyperspec</a>, which is an on-line version of the Common Lisp specification. 

* Peter Siebel has written a book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590592395/qid=1109964530/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/104-5541083-7083919?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Practical Common Lisp</a>, and has gotten permission to put it  <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">online</a> indefinately.

<i>PS: Be sure to check out Olin Shiver's 
<a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~shivers/advisor-stmt-original.txt">
philosophy of undergraduate advising</a>. It's an example to be followed. ;-) </i>
