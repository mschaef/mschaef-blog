David Gainer has <a
href="http://blogs.msdn.com/excel/archive/2005/10/11/479713.aspx">Summarized
a a number of new conditional formatting rules in Excel 12</a>, over
on the Excel 12 blog. These rules were designed to <i>"make a greater
number of scenarios possible without needing to write formulas."</i>
In other words, all these scenarios have simple solutions directly
visible in the Excel 12 UI.

Well, if you can't wait for Excel 12, Excel is pretty darned powerful
as it is, and as Mr. Gainer states: most of these scenarios have
formula-based approaches that work right now. Here are some of the
approaches for current versions of Excel:

* With data bars, color scales, or icons based on the numeric value in
  the cell, percentages, percentiles, or a formula. See the posts on
  data bars, color scales, and icon sets for more information on each
  of these. - <b><a

  This approach to 'databars'</a> generalizes to formula-based
  scaling, although it's not as pretty, not a color scale, and not an
  icon set. </b>

* Containing, not containing, beginning with, or ending with specific
  text.  For example, highlighting parts containing certain characters
  in a parts catalog. - <b>Use a formula: a lot of these conditions
  can be tested using `FIND`: `=FIND(string, A1)=1`, checks for
  parts that begin with <i>string</i>, for example.</b>

* Containing dates that match dynamic conditions like yesterday,
  today, tomorrow, in the last 7 days, last week, this week, next
  week, last month, this month, next month.  For example, highlight
  all items dated yesterday.  The great part about these conditions is
  that Excel handles calculating the date based on the system clock,
  so the user doesn.t need to worry about updating the condition. -
  <b>Use a formula: the system date is available via `NOW()`, and
  Excel offers plenty of date arithmetic functions to check for
  specific conditions.</b>

* That are blank or that are non-blank. - <b>Use a formula:
  `=ISBLANK(A1)` or `=NOT(ISBLANK(A1))`</b>

* That have errors or that do not have errors. - <b>Use a formula:
  `=ISERROR(A1)` or `=NOT(ISERROR(A1))`</b>

* That are in the top n of a selected range (where n is whatever
  number you want) OR that are in the top n percent of a selected
  range (again, where n is adjustable). For example, highlighting the
  top 10 investment returns in a table of 1,000 investments. - <b>Use
  a formula: `=RANK(A1, range) > n`.</b>

* Cells that have the bottom n values OR cells that are the bottom n
  percent of a selected range. - <b>Use a formula: `=RANK(A1,
  range)<ROWS(range)-<i>n</i>`.</b>

* Cells that are above average, below average, equal to or above
  average, equal to or below average, 1 standard deviation above, 1
  standard deviation below, 2 standard deviations above, 2 standard
  deviations below, 3 standard deviations above, 3 standard deviations
  below a selected range. - <b> This type of thing can be solved using
  a particular form of formula:
  `=A1<(AVERAGE(ange)-n*STDEV(range))` or
  `=A1>(AVERAGE(ange)+n*STDEV(range))`. For
  large ranges, it probably makes sense to move the computation of
  AVERAGE and STDEV into a cell, and have the conditional format
  reference (with an absolute reference) that cell.</b>

* Cells that are duplicate values or, conversely, cells that are
  unique values. - <b>Use a formula: `=COUNTIF(range, A1)=1` or
  `=COUNTIF(range, A1)>1`. Ensure that the range you use in
  the formula has an absolute address. If your range is sorted on the
  'key' field, you can use this style of formula:
  `=A1<>A2`. This can be much, much faster, particularly for
  large tables. (<i>For the Comp. Sci. types it's O(N), rather than
  O(N^2 ), once you have sorted data.</i>)</b>

* Based on comparisons between two columns in tables.  For example,
  highlight values where values in the .Actual Sales. column are less
  than in the .Sales Target. column. - <b>Use a conditional format
  formula: `=A1<B1`. Apply it to the entire column you want shaded,
  and Excel will evaluate the seperately for each cell.  The cell
  references in the format formula are relative to the current cell in
  the selected range. The current cell is the cell in the range that
  is <b>not</b> highlighted (but is surrounded by a selection border),
  and can be moved around the four corners of the range with
  Control+. (period).</b>

* When working with tables, we have also made it easy to format the
  entire row based on the results of a condition. - <b>Relative
  formulas can be made to do this: select an entire range, and define
  a conditional formula using absolute column addresses (ie:
  `=$a1`). Excel evaluates the format formula for each cell in the
  range, and since the column addresses are absolute, each cell in a
  row will pull from the came columns. Therefore, each cell in a row
  will share the same conditional format, which is what we want.</b>

Based on this, you don't have to wait for Excel 12 to get a lot of
these features, you just have to wait for Excel 12 if you want Excel
to do it for you automatically. My suggestion would be to learn how to
use conditional formatting formulas, but I tend to be <i>"here's how
to fish"</i> kind of guy more than a <i>"here's a fish"</i> kind of
guy.
