I ran across this quote the other day from
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit19971014.html">I, cringely</a>:

> The market has stupidly decided that Intel microprocessors are better
> than Apple's preferred PowerPCs, so Apple will be at a disadvantage trying
> to sell PowerPC machines into the Intel market. This is what's right now
> killing Silicon Graphics, which is finding rough going pitting its MIPS
> processors against Intel. ... Yes, Apple will build computers with Intel
> processors. Their aim, as in all of these products, is for the high end.
> Based on Intel's new Merced chip, the new Apple machine will have PCI
> slots, Universal Serial Bus, Fast Ethernet, IEEE 1394 FireWire, IRDA,
> DIMM sockets, but no ISA slots and no backwards compatibility to DOS. So
> this is NOT a PC in the strictest sense, since it will only run Rhapsody,
> but not System 8 or Windows NT. It will run Mac applications inside Rhapsody.
> And because Apple is both the author of Rhapsody and the designer of this

Funny thing is... that quote is from October of *1997*. A lot
has changed since then, but since the core reasoning was sound it
probably shouldn't be too much of a suprise that he was ultimately
right.

The other interesting bit was that Cringely wrote that piece around 1997,
which is when <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit19971113.html">
the NDA for 'Project Star Trek' expired</a>. Star Trek was a project in
which a few Apple, Novell, and Intel software engineers got MacOS 7 running
on PC hardware. I'm not sure what the business story would've been, but 
it was a nice technical accomplishment nonetheless.
