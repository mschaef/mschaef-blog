I have a new favorite blog, the <a
href="http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com/">Linux Hater's Blog</a>. Some
anonymous Linux user has taken it upon himself to open a blog
dedicated to all of the many reasons why desktop Linux sucks (which it
does). While it's more than a little mean-spirited, this blog is the
dissenting voice of Linux. It is the conscience that, if heeded, will
make the Linux desktop a better place to work.

For all of the problems with Linux, it is also the one major platform
that allows the motivated individual or company to actually address
those problems. The single biggest difference between the Linux
Hater's Blog and the (would-be) Windows and MacOS X Hater's Blogs is
that on the Linux blog, it's actually possible to do something about
the problems. Consider this: 18 years ago, there was no Linux, 12
years ago, there was no Gnome. In 1990, the Linux Hater's blog would
have one post: <i>"It doesn't exist, go buy Windows."</i> The reason I
mention this is that while it's easy to dismiss the benefits of open
source as purely theoretical (i.e.: <i>"Have <b>you</b> ever needed to
recompile your kernel?"</i>), the benefits of open source are the
entire reason it exists at all.

To look at this in a bit more depth, consider the gnome-panel as an
example. Based on the copyright claims in the source code, gnome-panel
is itself a collaboration of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eazel">Eazel</a>, <a
href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/helix-history.html">Helix
Code</a>/Ximian/Novell, <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun
Microsytems</a>, <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a>, <a
href="http://www.fsf.org">The Free Software Foundation</a>, <a
href="http://ian.mckellar.org/">Ian McKellar</a>, James Wilcox, Rob
Adams, <a href="http://live.gnome.org/VincentUntz">Vincent Untz</a>,
and <a href="http://carlosgc.linups.org/">Carlos Garcia
Campos</a>. All of these contributors found things to change or fix,
'itches to scratch', and all of them changed or fixed the
gnome-panel. This is something that basically cannot happen in the
model of closed source software. If you want to change something in
MacOS X, you basically have three options: try to convince Apple it is
a worthwhile change by trying to present (giving up the rights to) a
business case justifying the feature, try to go to work for Apple in
the right group and convince them to let you implement your feature,
or reimplement the entire thing yourself.

As a result of these kinds of trade offs, cross-organization collaboration 
in closed source is a lot harder to come by than in open source. Closed 
source essentially divides the stakeholders in a piece of software into 
two groups: those that can take responsibility for the softawre by making 
changes, and those that cannot and must either accept the changes as 
provided or work around them. In that sense, Free Software is the 
licencing model that brings to software the democratic ideals of personal 
responsibility and the sovereignty of the people. Like any democracy, in 
the short term it will have issues compared to more centralized forms of 
planning, but in the long term it will be a much more vibrant and 
productive place to be. This is also why the Linux Hater's Blog is so very 
important. To see why, continue the analogy with democracy a bit, and 
consider the process by which the United Stated adopted its constitution.

After the U.S. Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, there came the 
long and highly political process of states ratifying new form of 
government.  During this two year long debate, there were a series of 
papers, the Federalist Papers, written in support of the proposed 
Constutition. Less well known are the Anti-Federalist papers, a series of 
dissenting arguments <i>against</i> ratification. This dissent primarily 
centered around the lack of a Bill of Rights, and ultimatly led to the 
incorporation of a Bill of Rights as the first ten amendments to the 
constitution. The dissent was not just criticism: open process and free 
debate allowed it to be a key part of the construction of the 
Constitution.

This is a much grander version of what the Linux Hater's blog can do for 
Linux. By dissenting against the idea that Linux is already ready for the 
desktop (or the server), it also provides a list of weaknesses to fix.  
Unlike a Windows Hater's Blog, the freedoms of Linux allow this list of 
weaknesses to effectively become a to do list for anyone or any company 
with the motivation and time to do the work. It is therefore not a 
liabilty to Linux, but an asset that derives its value from the freedom at 
the core of Free Software. Ironically enough, because of this, the 'Linux 
Hater' could easily turn out to be one of Linux's best friends.
