FoxTales</a>, dropped me a note regarding a <a 
href="http://www.mschaef.com/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/tech/general/pentium_chronicles.txt">
comment</a> I made about his book back in January. I thought it was worth 
repeating part of my response here:

<br><br>

<i>"Like I said in January, the book brought back memories of the
first few years of my career.  Obviously the details are different, but if
my kids ever ask about the beginning of my career I'll point them to your
book first. You did an excellent job capturing the spirit of commercial
software development."</i>

I re-skimmed the book last night (setting aside a brand-new copy
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_J._Date">C.J. Date</a>'s
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/databaseid/">Database
in Depth,</a> ironically enough), and it still
seems relevant, six months after the initial read. That's always a 
good sign.
