title: A few logistical notes

With <a href="http://www.mschaef.com/blog/personal/ryan_charles">Ryan</a>'s
arrival, my blog is going to start containing more non-techical material.
To avoid forcing people into reading about the poopie diapers and/or lexical
closures they aren't interested in, I've partitioned the blog into a couple
of sub-feeds.  I've also started using URL rewriting to remove the reference
to <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/">blosxom</a> from links to the weblog. 
Links to this weblog should now look like this: 
<tt>http://www.mschaef.com/blog/personal/ryan_charles</tt>.
The old style links should work as long I continue using blosxom, but if that 
ever
changes they will start failing. (I'll try to put permanent redirections in 
place
to avoid too many problems with obsolete links.)  Without further ado,
here are the good weblog links:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mschaef.com/blog/">All content</a>
    (<a href="http://www.mschaef.com/blog/index.rss">RSS</a>)
<li><a href="http://www.mschaef.com/blog/personal/">Personal content only</a>
    (<a href="http://www.mschaef.com/blog/personal/index.rss">RSS</a>)
<li><a href="http://www.mschaef.com/blog/tech/">Technical content only</a>
    (<a href="http://www.mschaef.com/blog/tech/index.rss">RSS</a>)
</ul>
