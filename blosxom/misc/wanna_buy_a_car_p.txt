Let's see, the modern car buying experience is:

<ul>
<li>Pay interest to borrow money to fund the capital cost of your car.
<li>Pay to maintain the car.
<li>Pay to repair the car when it breaks out of warranty.
<li>Pay for consumables like tires, oil, and brake pads.
<li>Pay for gas to fuel the car.
<li>Spend your time driving yourself around.
</ul>

Don't get me wrong, I like cars as much as the next red-blooded
American guy, but if you view your car as anything other than a 
tremendous expense, you really need to rethink your point of view.
