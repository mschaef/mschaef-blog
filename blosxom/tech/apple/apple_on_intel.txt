Apple on Intel - Not^H^H^H gonna happen

So, the big rumor is that <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/06/1131250&tid=118&tid=181&tid=3">
Apple is switching to Intel processors</a>, and Steve Jobs is going to make the announcement during his
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a> keynote address this morning (10:00AM PST).  I had been
planning on writing a debunking article, but now I'm not so sure. Here's why:

<tr bgcolor="#bbbbbb"><td><b>Reason not to switch</b></td><td><b>Counterargument</b></td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td>
   If Apple switches to Intel, they introduce another archicture break into their
   hardware platform.
</td><td>
   Emulation can make existing binaries run seamlessly on Intel.
</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td>
   But isn't emulation really slow?
</td><td>
   Modern emulation technology has gotten a lot better, it can compile code
   on the fly, just like a modern JVM or Virtual PC.
</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td>
   But I've run virtual machines before, and they're still really slow.
</td><td>
   All of the operating system services can be made to run natively, at full
   speed. The only thing that will be emulated is the application code itself.
   So, except for very computation-intensive application code things could still
   run smoothly.
</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td>
   Okay, but a lot of OS X (like Quartz Extreme) is optimized to run on Macintosh
   hardware.
</td><td>
   Macintosh video hardware is the exact same as PC video hardware these days. In
   fact, most of the supporting hardware in  Macintosh is the same as on a PC.  
</td></tr>


<tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td>
   The PowerPC is part of Apple's 'uniqueness'.
</td><td>
   It doesn't matter to most consumers what chip or ISA is running their software.
   The reason people pay for Apple, their core unique value, is their appealing
   design and the attenion they spend developing a well integrated system.  Even if
   Apple switches to Intel, there's no reason any of that has to change. (Anyway, they
   could still do something pretty unusual, like putting a Pentium M in a desktop).
</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td>
    Lots of new stuff in Tiger like CoreImage uses AltiVec a great deal.
</td><td>
    CoreImage actually compiles dataflow graphs to native hardware at runtime,
    picking the approach that runs best on the target hardware. CoreImage could
    well compile to x86/SSE2 (or whatever else). That means that even a PPC
    binary running emulated on an Intel Macintosh could have access to full speed
    CoreImage services compiled to SSE2.
</td><tr>

<tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td>
    This will alienate existing PowerPC customers.
</td><td>
     Why does it have to? If their emulation works well enough, Apple could easily
     introduce Intel hardware and <i>retain PowerPC as the standard binary format</i>
     for a while. The common case for ISV's would be to continue developing PowerPC
     binaries and selling into both the x86/OSX and PPC/OSX markets.  The only 'schism'
     would be arise for software vendors who had to have full performance on x86/OSX.
     They'd have to worry about shipping some kind of fat binary that ran on both
     platforms. There still, PPC/OSX customers wouldn't see a difference.
</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td>
    Will Windows run on an Intel Mac? Won't that make it easier for Microsoft
    to drop Office for OS X?
</td><td>
    Apple could easily make it virtually impossible to run Windows on whatever
    hardware they sell. With respect to Office for OS X, Microsoft doesn't really
    care what the target archicture is: they just want to sell licenses to Office.
    They'll go where the money is, and that might end up being an OSX/Intel port.
</td></tr>

Now that I think about it, the switch to Intel would basically boil down to the same
story Apple told in 1993, when it initially switched from the Motorola 680X0 to the
PowerPC. Apple pulled it off well in 1993, and now they have the benefit of experience
(they've done it before), better emulation technology, and an already more standard
hardware platform. It seems plausible to me. The only thing that's left is to figure
out why they'd do it, and I have some ideas there too:

<ul>
<li>They could finally move their laptops to a faster chip than the G4.
<li>x86 is not going away and it's not going to end up marginalized any time soon. This
    could be a 'final' switch.
<li>If IBM is growing cold on the desktop CPU business (and who could blame them), Apple's
    hand might be forced into switching away from PPC. Right now, IBM is the only high
    performance CPU story Apple has.
</ul>
    

Anyway, let's see what Jobs says...
