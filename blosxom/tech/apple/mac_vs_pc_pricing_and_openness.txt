Macintosh vs. PC Pricing, and missing the point.

Harry McCracken just wrote <a

a bit</a> comparing the price of PC's to Macintosh's. Like most of these 
guys, he misses the point. Consider his methodology: <i>"I chose a 
standard [Apple] MacBook configuration...Then I configured laptops as 
similarly as possible from the country's two largest PC 
manufacturers"</i>. The problem is that this methodology takes the set 
of Apple machines to be the set of valid configurations for comparison, 
excluding configurations that Apple does not offer. Just for the sake of 
a more full comparison, what does a MacBook cost with these 
configurations?

<ul>
<li>A TrackPoint.
<li>A numeric keypad.
<li>Two internal batteries.
<li>Two internal mouse buttons.
<li>A swappable drive bay.
<li>A docking station.
<li>A calibrated, high-gamut display and a digitizer.
<li>A display smaller than 13" or bigger than 17".
<li>No keyboard.
<li>A convertable tablet configuration.
<li>Embedded on a PXI card.
<liThe absolute highest performance.
<li>The absolute minimum cost.
</ul>

Of course, none of these configurations are available from Apple. If you
need or want one of these options, you can't get it at any price from 
Apple. Similar comparisons can be made in the server and desktop PC 
spaces.

This is an unsuprising result. When you enlarge the playing field beyond 
Apple's relatively limited reach, it becomes even more apparant that 
these comparisons aren't 'Apple vs. PC' what they really are is 'Apple 
vs. The Entire Computer Industry'. Apple doesn't have the capability, 
desire, or brand to fare well in such a comparison: There are just too 
many market segments they don't address. Addressing all of these 
segments would leave them with a confusing product line, a highly taxed 
engineering group, and a muddled brand image.

Part of the value of the PC platform is that it not subject to the 
limitations of being confined to one highly image-sensitive company. 
Part of the value of the PC is that it allows other vendors to enlarge 
the platform into new segments. Missing out on this is one of the costs 
of picking an Apple that is missing in most comparisons, including 
McCracken's.
