Arc Hub

<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a> solicited comments on
his <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html">Arc</a> programming
language a few years ago. These comments are 
<a href="http://www.archub.org/arcsug.txt">online</a>, and are very
interesting reading. Lots of good comments.
