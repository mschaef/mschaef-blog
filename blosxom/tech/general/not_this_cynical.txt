I hope I never get this cynical about our industry...

<i>"Look, the tech industry is and always will be fucked up. They still 
somehow manage to make a semi-usable product every once in a while. My Mac 
is slow as a dog, even though it has two CPUs and cost $5000, but I use it 
anyway because it's prettier and slightly more fun than the crap Microsoft 
and Dell ship. But give me a reason to switch, even a small one, and I'm 
outta here. "</i> &mdash; <a

If you don't know who <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/dave/">Dave 
Winer</a> is, he pioneered the development of <a 
href="http://www.outliners.com/">outlining software</a> back in the 80's, 
developed one of the first system scripting tools for the Macintosh, 
invented <a 
href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$555">XML-RPC</a>, and 
invented the <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss">RSS 
specification</a> you're probably using to read this blog post. I'm not 
trying to belittle this guy's point of view, but he's been responsible for 
developing several major pieces of consumer application software, designed 
a couple hugely significant internet procotols, and <a 
href="http://www.kottke.org/05/10/weblogscom-sold-to-verisign">made some 
signficant money in the process</a>. Most people should be so lucky.
