Sleepers, Awake.

Now that the new year has begun, the holiday season lull in
blog posts has started to abate.  I had wondered if posts would
go down in frequency or up, since people had more time to
dedicate to 'extracurricular' activities.  Now we (I?)
know.

<br><br>

The next interesting question is that since blog posts
seem like they might be inversely correlated with vacation
time, is blogging actually actively sponsored by employers?
That is, are there firms where a high profile as a blogger
will lead to things like good performance reviews, raises,
and good assignments?

<br><br>

Even at the most open minded, technically progressive firms
I've worked at, I am 100% positive that blogging activities
would have been considered a distant priority behind shipping and 
supporting product. Maybe it's old fashioned of me to say it,
but that seems like the correct approach.
