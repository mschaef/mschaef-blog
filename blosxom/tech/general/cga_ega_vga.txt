CGA... EGA... VGA... ... ... WQUXGA?!?!?

I thought these acronyms were dead 15 years ago, when SuperVGA and
the 8514/A started to replace the VGA. here's a 
<a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/howmanydots/">good history
and glossary of the terms</a>, but what's wrong with "2.3MP, 16:10"
instead of WUXGA? So much simpler, and it also provides a decent
way to compare screen resolutions with digital camera resolutions.
