UseHR, I give up!!!

A few months ago I wrote <a href="http://www.mschaef.com/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/tech/general/usehr_and_the_web.txt">a bit
</a> on the impact of high resolution displays on the way Internet Explorer renders graphics. I had really planned
on using the default setting. Not anymore! 

<br><br>

This is the awful default:<br>

  width="346" height="356">

<br><br>

This is as it should be:<br>
