Seymour Cray

For some reason, I've been thinking a lot lately about Seymour Cray.
When I was growing up, I remember asking my dad
about who made the fastest computers in the world, and
the answer at the time was Cray. I don't know if he meant 
the man or the company, but for a while both were true. I 
suppose it made an impression.

<br><br>

I've found a bunch of good things online about the man and his work:

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.spikynorman.dsl.pipex.com/CrayWWWStuff/">http://www.spikynorman.dsl.pipex.com/CrayWWWStuff/</a>
</ul>

Reading through them, a couple of things made impressions on me:

<ul>
<li>He didn't mind throwing bad ideas away (or saving them for later).  The Cray 1 
    took a very different approach from the CDC 8600.

<li>Cray failed a lot. He was always pushing the limits and taking risks, and
    paid the price of those risks. The CDD 8600 failed, as did several designs
    for the Cray 2. The Cray 3 failed to sell, and the 4 doesn't seem to have
    hit the prototype stage at all. Even the Cray 2 doesn't seem to have been
    an unqualified success, thanks to issues with memory bandwidth.

<li>He had a very 'startup mentality'.  His career seems
    to be a repeating story of initial success, spin off lab, and spin
    off company. 

<li>A lot of his design problems weren't electronic at all. He seems
    to have struggled as much (if not more) with packaging and cooling
    as with anything else.

<li>He had a keen sense of style. With the possible exception of
    the <a href="http://mission.base.com/tamiko/cm/cm-image.html">Connection
    Machine CM-1/2</a>, his machines were the most visually striking of the
    major supercomputers. Maybe it's superficial, but it can't have
    hurt the sales or publicity.

<li>He knew what he had accomplished. There's a story about his suprise
    when Steve Chen developed the X-MP from the Cray 1 and doubled (?)
    the performance. Of course, the story goes on to describe how Cray
    ended up appreciating the new design.

</ul>

Anyway, I have nothing but the utmost respect for the man and his
accomplishments. R.I.P, Mr. Cray.
