From USB port to battery charger...

I don't know how plausible it is, but it'd be awfully nice if laptops had
a way to power USB ports when the machine is off but plugged in. Perhaps this
could be controlled by a switch on the side of the case that turns on USB power
only.

The use case, of course, is for portable devices that can charge their batteries
over a USB connection. Apple has stopped bundling anything except a USB cable
with the iPod, and it's pretty easy to find USB power cords for PDA's and
cell phones. With this kind of functionality in a laptop, the laptop could
become a traveler's one central power adapter, eliminating the need to
carry large numbers of dedicated adapters or half-baked partial solutions
like the <a href="http://www.igo.com">iGo</a>. I can see paying 50-60 dollars
extra for a laptop with this feature.

Another way this could be implemented would be to put 3-4 power-only USB
ports on the laptop's power brick.
