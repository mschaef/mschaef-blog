The Portland Pattern Repository

A year or two ago, I started noticing a disproportionate number
of my programming queries on Google ended up at <a href="http://www.c2.com">
www.c2.com</a>. A little exploration showed the web server to be the 
host of the <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki">Portland Pattern
Repository</a>, the original Wiki, and dedicated to software
engineering related topics (for the most part). The site is highly
worth spending some time reading.
