UseHR, High Resolution Displays, and the Internet

For a few years, I used this graphic as the front matter for
my website:

<br><br>

<center>
        <img src="http://www.mschaef.com/pics\p_intro.png"
             width="494" height="70"
             alt="michael.schaeffer"
             class="borderless">
</center>

<br><br>

This, the logo for my website, is basically just antialiased 
text rendered into a bitmap. At the time, it seemed like a
good idea to render the text as a bitmap because I didn't
trust the browser to render it for me.  Bad idea.

<br><br>

As it turns out, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/author/dhtml/overview/highdpi.asp">Internet 
Explorer</a>
rescales bitmaps on high resolution displays. This is a somewhat misguided
attempt to make keep bitmap sizing consistent. Bitmaps aren't rendered at 1/1 zoom,
they are rendered at screen_dpi/96dpi. On non-96dpi screens, that results in ugly
scaling. While <a href="http://www.nigelcoldwell.co.uk/userhr/">scaling can
be disabled</a>, that's not the ideal solution.  The ideal solution is to
do as much of the rendering as possible in the browser: which should know more
about the client's display than the server. Therefore, my logo is
now CSS formatted plain text. That means it looks the right size on more
screens, anti-aliases appropriately, uses ClearType if it's available. The next
step is going to be to switch from pixel sizes to 'real' sizes.
