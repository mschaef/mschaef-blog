DCOM Server Process Launcher

I took a look around my computer for information on the "DCOM Server Process Launcher" referred to in <a 
href="http://www.mschaef.com/cgi-bin/my_blosxom.cgi/tech/general/the_even_more_abominable_dialog_box.txt">this post</a>.  
Fortunately, Microsoft's services control panel has a place to put descriptive text.  The description for the "DCOM Server 
Process Launcher" reads "Provides Launch Functionality for DCOM Services".  Seriously.

<br><br>

Why even bother trying? A Microsoft PM documented this description feature. A programmer
coded it. A tester tested it. A writer wrote the text. Another writer documented the
feature. Translators translated it into 60 different languages. All so that Windows
could show a description that is <b>exactly as useless as the name of the service</b>.

The smallest disk Dell sells on their cheapest laptop is 40GB. Is it really too much
to ask for the description to include text closer to this?

services and processes to function correctly -- including the Windows Firewall. " <br>

For bonus points, the service description would also be available from the fault notification dialog box, possibly with 
hyperlinks to the appropriate developer information on MSDN (which could also be stored locally). The whole key here: trust 
the user of your product and enable them to use it efficiently.
