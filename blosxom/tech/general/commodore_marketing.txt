Commodore Amiga Marketing

Heh... saw some quotes on <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>
referring to Commodore's marketing of the old Amiga. I thought they were
funny enough to share here:

<ul>
<li><i>If Commodore bought KFC they would have changed the name to "Warm dead 
    birds in a paper bucket". </i>
<li><i>Commodore Sushi: Cold, dead, raw fish.</i>
</ul>

I have no idea what the attribution should be for these.
