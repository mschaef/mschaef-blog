Jef Raskin

Reading <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> today, I heard
that <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/apple/05/02/27/1835231.shtml?tid=3">
Jef Raskin has passed away from cancer</a>. If you don't know who Jef is,
it's safe to say that you have been influenced by his ideas if you're reading
this blog.

<br><br>

Dr. Raskin was one of the first human interface experts to contribute to
and be involved in the <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple Macintosh</a>.
computer.  While it's true that the design took a different direction from
some of his initial ideas, he played a major role in defining the user interface
ethic of the Macintosh, and consequently basically every other major computer
interface.

<br><br>

After leaving Apple, Jef went on to continue his ideas with the SwyftCard and
<a href="http://www.landsnail.com/apple/local/cat/canon.html">Canon Cat</a>.
The best articulation I've seen of his ideas regarding interface design is
in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201379376/qid=1109552328/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-0098463-1793712?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">The Humane Interface</a>. He has also put a great deal of his work on his <a href="http://jef.raskincenter.org/home/index.html">personal website</a>.

<br><br>

This is a sad day, indeed.
