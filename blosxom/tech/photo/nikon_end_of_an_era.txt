The End of an Era...

Nikon has just announced its intent to discontinue production of most
of its non-Digital cameras. In a digital world, this isn't too suprising,
but for someone who grew up with Nikon film cameras, it's a bittersweet
thing.

One notable thing about the announcement is that it also includes lenses 
for large format cameras and enlargers. These are both low volume but 
highly significant markets. Large format cameras are view cameras, cameras 
that offer incredible control over perspective as well as the ability to 
use very large film for very high resolution. A large format camera might 
have 80 times the negative size of a 35mm SLR: in digital terms that is 
roughly equivalent to 80 times the number of pixels. Large format cameras 
are what <a href="http://www.anseladams.com"> Ansel Adams</a> used and 
represent the very highest performance film cameras. If there was one area 
where film was likely to offer unique value over digital, this was it.
