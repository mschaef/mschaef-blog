Programming Well: Global Variables

Global variables tend get a bad rap, kind of like goto and pointers.
Personally, I think they can be pretty useful if you are careful.
Here are the guidelines I use to determine if a global variable
is an appropriate solution:

<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Will there ever be a need for more than one instance of the variable? 


<li>How much complexity does passing the variable to all its accessors
    entail? 
    <br>

<li>Does the variable represent global state? (A heap free list, configuration
    information, a pool of threads, a global mutex, etc.) 
    <br>

<li>Can the data be more effectively modeled as a static variable in a
    function or private member variable in a singleton object? <i>(Both
    of these are other forms of global storage, but they wrap the variable
    accesses in accessor functions.)</i>
    <br>

<li>Can you support the lifecycle you need for the variable any other way? Global
    variables exist for the duration of your program's run-time. Local variables
    exist for the duration of a function. If you don't have heap allocated
    variables, or if your heap allocator sucks, then a global variable might
    be the best way to get to storage that lasts longer than any one function
    invocation.
    <br>

<lI>Do you need to use environment features that are specific to globals? 
    In MSVC++, this can mean things like <a href="http://www.thecodeproject.com/dll/data_seg_share.asp">
    specifying the segment in which a global is stored</a> or declaring a variable as
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vclang/html/_pluslang_the_thread_attribute.asp">thread-local</a>. 
    <br>


    
</ul>

If all that leads you to the decision that a global variable is the best 
choice, you can then take steps to mitigate some of the risks involved.
The first thing i'd  do is prefix global variable names with a unique
qualifier, maybe  something like g_.  This lowers the risk of namespace
collisions as well as clearely denotes what variables are global, when you
have to read or alter your code. If you have multiple global variables,
I'd also be tempted to wrap them all up in a structure, for some of the
same reasons.
