Updating Posts

One of the 'downsides' of the way <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/">Blosxom</a> 
is implemented is that is relies on a post file's modification date to assign a 
date to the post.  This makes editing files a little tricky: editing files on a 
Unix box updates the modification date and therefore promotes the post to the 
top of the blog.  I don't know if there's a better way to do this, but I've 
written a little script that edits a file, making sure to restore the previous 
modification date.

<br><br>

The implementation is pretty simple: it uses <tt>mktemp</tt> to create a 
temporary file and <tt>touch -r</tt> to copy the modification dates from the 
post file to the temporary file and back. Be sure to modify the <tt>#!</tt> line 
to point to your installation of bash, should you decide to use this script. A 
nice generalization of this script would have it prompt for a description of the 
update and add the text to the post.

<pre class="syntax">
#!/usr/local/bin/bash

if [ $# -ne 1 ]
then
  echo
  echo "This script expects a command line argument: the
  echo "name of the post to edit."
  exit 1
fi

DATE_MARKER=`mktemp /tmp/date_marker.XXXXXX` || exit 1

touch -r $1 ${DATE_MARKER}

${EDITOR} $1

touch -r ${DATE_MARKER} $1

rm ${DATE_MARKER}
