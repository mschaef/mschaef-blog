More style updates...

With some advice from <a 
href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/lab/developing_with_web_standards/csslayout/2-col/">this 
site</a>, I've slightly tweaked the layout of the blog. The sidebar is now 
one color all the way down, and some of the <tt>&lt;pre&gt;</tt> text in 
some older posts is now formatted to fit smaller lines.
