Blosxom is a pain in the ass^H^H^Hbutt...

My blog setup requires that I log in via ssh to my webserver
to use a text editor to edit articles in raw HTML. This is the
downside of using barebones blog software. On the flip side,
it'd at least be pretty easy to add a (private) article
submission form. All it would have to do is present a list
of subdirectories in the blosxom hierarchy, and allow content
from a text box to be deposited into a named file with a
specified timestamp (which can be set with touch). Step 2:
allow these files to be edited in a text box.
