Blosxom, Annotated

<a href="http://www.hecker.org/">Frank Hecker</a>, in an effort to teach himself 
more about <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/">Blosxom</a> has done a <b>cool</b>
thing. He has taken the source for Blosxom and
<a href="http://www.frankhecker.org/blosxom/annotations">annotated it</a> with 
extra comments to describe what it's doing each step of the way. I don't
know if I'll ever use the knowledge to hack Blosxom, but it's still good
reading.
