General posts on a topic don't go at the root...

Maybe this should have been obvious from the beginning, but
I'm no longer putting "general interest" blog posts at
the root for the topic. Rather, those posts are now going
under a "general" subtopic of the root.

The problem with making general interest posts at the root
of a topic is that there's then no way to watch only the
general topics. If you look at the root topic, you get
the whole topic.
