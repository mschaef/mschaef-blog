The "Star of the American Road"

Oddly enough, the search term that brings the most visitors
to my little website is "Texaco". I suspect most of those people
go away totally unsatisfied, but there is a decent story behind the
connection:

<br><br>

About ten years ago, a good friend of mine went to work in Texaco's
IT Shop as a summer intern.  One of his job responsibilities was
to develop an intranet website. I forget the details, but somewhere
along the way he decided he wanted to put a fancy banner picture
atop the page.  At the time, we were both interested in ray 
tracing, so we decided to throw together a raytraced version of
the Texaco Star logo.

<br><br>

Using our copious free time, we found an online copy of the Texaco logo,
took measurements of the star and rendered it as a white solid set against a metallic
red hemisphere. We even went to the trouble of animating the star so it
rotates, generating a bunch of frames and using a GIF tool to put together
an animated GIF. The final result was a nicely animated Texaco logo with
an "attractive" (This is by 1995 intranet standards, remember) banner to the side. 
Since then, I've dragged the model out, re-rendered it at higher resolution, and
stuck it in a  little

For some reason, that picture brings more visitors to this site than
anything else. If you happen across this site and actually use the image for
something you owe its presence to a ten year old accident of fate.
