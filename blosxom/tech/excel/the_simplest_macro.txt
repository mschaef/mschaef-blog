Excel: 'Repeat', the Simplest Macro

This is a simple little two-bit Excel trick that I find myself
using <b>all the time</b>, particularly when formatting worksheets.

<br><Br>

In Excel, Control+Y is the 'other half' of the Undo/Redo pair.
If you undo an action and want to redo what you just undid,
Control+Y undoes the undo, so to speak.  However, if you haven't
undone anything, and there's nothing on the redo queue, <b>Control+Y
repeats the last single action you took</b>.

<br><br>

Repeatable actions can actually be quite complex. For example,
opening the Format Cell dialog box and applying a format counts
as one repeatable action, regardless of how many format attributes
you change. Once you make that format change to one cell and <b>before
you do anything else</b> Control+Y has become a key that applies
that specific format change to as many other cells as you like.

<br><br>

In a sense, Control+Y is a command that's eternally bound to a
simple macro that Excel keeps updating with your last action.
If you plan your work to group actions together, this 'automatic'
macro can save a lots of time.
