List filtering with Formulas in Microsoft Excel: Motivation

One of Excel's more interesting features for querying data sets
is the AutoFilter. Applied to a table of data in a spreadsheet,
The AutoFilter allows the table to be queried for subsets of data
based on combo boxes in the table's header row. It's a simple way
to filter out extraneous data and it can support quite elaborate
query semantics (since it can filter based on values in computed
cells).

However, AutoFilter is not without its problems:

<ul>

<li>AutoFilter imposes its own user interface: if you want a
    look-and-feel other than stock, you're out of luck.

<li>For wide data tables with lots of columns, it can be hard to see
    the current AutoFilter query. To see the entire query requires
    horizontal scrolling down the header row.

<li>Cell formatting and AutoFilter are independant of each other.
    If you want position dependant formatting (alternate row
    formatting, for example), it has to be recreated
    after each AutoFilter adjustment.

<li>An AutoFilter works by selectively 'hiding' rows in the
    worksheet it's a part of. This means that an AutoFiltered
    list can't share rows with anything else that you don't
    also want selectively 'filtered' from view.

<li>You can't have more than one AutoFilter on a worksheet tab.

<li>AutoFilter isn't part of the natural 'ebb and flow' of
    the life of a spreadsheet: it doesn't participate in the
    dependancy driven formula solver that drives Excel's
    computational capability. This has some profound (bad)
    implications:

  <ul>
  <li>As data rows are added and removed from the list being 
      AutoFiltered, the AutoFilter has to be removed and
      reapplied to the new data list to reflect changes to its
      source.

  <li>You can't use AutoFilter to filter a list and then search
      that list with <tt>=LOOKUP()</tt> or <tt>=MATCH()</tt>: the
      lookup operation will search the <b>entire</b> list, not
      the filtered list.

  <li>If you AutoFilter a list that contains calculated cells,
      and those cells change value, the set of filtered rows is
      not updated.
  </ul>


</ul>

Anyway, I could go on, but I hope it's pretty clear by now that
there are sometimes good reasons to look for other list filter
mechanisms than AutoFilter. <i>(FYI: 'Advanced Filter' has its
own limitations, some of which are very similar to AutoFilter's.)</i>
I'll post a way to get AutoFilter-like behavior directly from
Excel formulas. This technique has its own issues, but it does
address lots of the issues I mentioned here.
