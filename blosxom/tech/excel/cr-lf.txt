title: Excel, CR/LF, and CSV

I've spent a fair amount of time lately working with code that generates 
Comma Seperated Value files for loading into Excel.  You'd think the 
format would be trivial, but <a 
href="http://www.creativyst.com/Doc/Articles/CSV/CSV01.htm#EmbedBRs">not quite</a>. One 
additional subtlety, one not covered in that 'specification', is Excel's inconsistent handling 
of end of line markers. As it turns out, if Excel loads a CSV file that contains a quoted, 
multi-line value, it expects a different line feed convention within the quoted value than the 
usual CR/LF. A CR embedded in a quoted field renders as a box, rather than as part of a newline. 
To suppress the box, CSV files for Excel need to be written with a LF-only convention within 
quoted values. Even then, Excel will not automatically expand rows containing a multi-line 
value. That has to be done manually.

<br><br>

Internally, Excel seems to follow the same LF-only convention that this issue with CSV files 
seems to imply.  Taking the <tt>CODE(...)</tt> of each character in a manually entered 
multi-line cell value, shows only one charater, a LF, at each line break. My guess is that the 
quotes in a CSV file just act as a signal to turn off <b>all</b> special character handling, not 
just handling that signals new rows and cells. Either way, it's more than a little irritating 
that Excel compatible CSV files with multi-line values have to have two seperate end of line 
conventions.
