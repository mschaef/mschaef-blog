New York Laundromat

Over the last several months, I've been spending a great deal of time
in New York City on business. In that time, I have never been quite
as suprised by prices as I have tonight. I wasn't even trying to
do anything all that unusual, just two loads of laundry.

<br><br>

Normally, I'd expect that two loads of laundry would cost about $6.
The washer would be $1.50 or so per run, and the dryer would be another
$1.50 per run, for a total of $6. Maybe even $7.50, if you decide to
run a second dryer cycle. Even in New York (west Midtown Manhattan),
I've been in apartments recently that charge about that much.

<br><br>

However, this apartment is special: they use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_card">
"smart" card</a> system to manage payments. There's a dispenser on the side of the wall that
sells $7 cards for $10 (cards themselves cost $3). The dispenser also allows you to reload cards in $5 and $10 
increments. Once you have a card, there are slots in each of the washers and dryers that
accept the card and debit from it the $2.50 it takes to buy a cycle in one of the machines. Yes, you
read that right: <b>$2.50</b>.  $2.50 in my apartment complex buys a 34 minute washer cycle
or a 30 (yes, 30) minute dryer cycle.

<br><br>

So tonight, I spent $15 (200% of my estimate) and got this:

<br><br>

<list>
<li>A $3 "smart" Card to carry around and not lose
<li>Two complete loads of laundry that will inevitably end up damp, thanks to the
pathetic dryer cycle.
<li>$2 of "change" on my "smart" card that I will <b>never</b> get to spend. (Since every
machine in the laundromat costs $2.50, and the card can only be reloaded with $5 or $10)
</list>

<br><br>

The part of this that bothers me the most is the $3 surcharge on the smart
card.  Thanks to the pricing structure of the laundromat, the $3 surcharge
really amounts to a $5 surcharge.
This means that someone was either stupid enough not to notice that customers would always
end up with $2 of useless change, or was malicious enough to use this as a sleazy way to
bilk customers out of an extra $2. Not to mention that I get the hassle of trying not to lose
this stupid card, lest I want to drop another $5 on yet another card.
