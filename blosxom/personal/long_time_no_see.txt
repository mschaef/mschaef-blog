Long Time, No See.

It seems that it's been a while since I've posted: about four months. 
That's longer then I meant, but isn't that always the case?

In the four months since I've not been posting, Ryan has crawled, learn to 
walk, learned to talk a little, and learned to respond to simple 
questions. Personally speaking, I've worked a bit on vCalc, not to mention 
the more important bill-paying work of my full time day job. Personally, I 
think Ryan is making me look like a slacker, but I suppose that's a matter 
of judgement. :-)

Anyway, I hope your holiday season was all you wanted it to be, and Happy 
New Year. I have a few ideas for new posts, so with some luck, the next 
gap won't be four months long.
