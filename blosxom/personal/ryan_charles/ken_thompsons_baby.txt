Ken Thompson's Baby

There's a long running <a
href="http://research.microsoft.com/~daniel/unix-haters.html">joke</a>
about <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson_(computer_programmer)">Ken
Thompson</a>'s car. It goes something like this: 'Ken Thompson's car
replaces all the confusing gauges with one warning light -- the
experienced user will know what's wrong when the light goes on.'  Ryan
is just like that if you replace the 'one warning light' with
'one piercing cry'. 

<br><br>

The compensating factor for Ryan's lack of communications skills is that babies 
don't need or want all that much. It basically boils down to food, clean clothes 
and diaper, a comfortable enviroment, and some companionship and cuddling. That 
makes an exhaustive search of all possible 'error conditions' relatively brief.  
It is frustrating at times (1:00 in the morning and nothing seems to be 
working), but I don't know if it'll end up more or less frustrating than 15-16 
years from now when he's asking for a new sports car or extended curfew.
