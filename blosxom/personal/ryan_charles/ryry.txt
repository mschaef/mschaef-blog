One of the criteria we had for picking Ryan's given name was
that it should be difficult to shorten into a nickname. This
is something Teresa has enjoyed about her name, and given my
dad's intense dislike of ever being called 'Stevie' it was
pretty easy to understand her position on the subject. Ryan
seemed like a safe choice until about two days after he was
born, at which point I lapsed into calling him 'Ry-Ry'. Oh
well. Ryan, If you ever hate the nickname 'Ry-Ry', let me
apologize now and get it over with. I kind of like it.
