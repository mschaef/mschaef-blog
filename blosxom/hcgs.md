The biggest thing that keeps the blogosphere from being an endless cesspool of 'happy critical guys' is 
that it explicitly forces readers to seek out and subscribe to each individual blog. In contrast, If 
you subscribe to a USENET newsgroup, the default behavior is that you see posts from all the 
contributors to the group. You can change this by explicitly killing threads or users, but, by default, 
you see it all. That makes it easier for individuals to gain readership, which arguably lowers quality.
