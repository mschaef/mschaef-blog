title: Should blog posts be written like a newspaper article?

Should blog posts be written with the <a href="http://www.freep.com/jobspage/academy/writing.htm">
essential content at the beginning</a> and less interesting details at the end?
Or is <a href="http://www.mschaef.com/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2005/06/01#apple_pricing">putting
the punchline at the end</a> acceptable?

<br><br>

Since people <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9710a.html">tend not to
read online</a>, and blogs are  often read in <a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com/">huge
volumes</a> via an <a href="http://www.sharpreader.com/">aggregator</a>, my hunch is 
that the title (and maybe the first paragraph) have to convince people your article is
worth the time...

<br><br>

More established bloggers, with a better track record of writing interesting
stuff, might have more leeway.
