A few months ago, my wife and I recently switched from a Sanyo 4700
and a 4900 on <a href="http://www.sprintpcs.com/">Sprint PCS</a> to a
pair of <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/t637/index.html">Sony
Ericsson T-637's</a> on <a
href="http://www.cingular.com/index">bCingular Wireless</a>. Overall,
the switch has been an improvement, but there are still a few nagging
issues:

* Cingular's selection of Java games is much sparser and more expensive than Sprint's.

* There's no "Phone Ringing" Ringtone on the phone, just a bunch of generic and/or
  unrecognizable music files.

* There are buttons on the side of the phone that activate the web browser and camera.
  These are pretty easy to hit by accident.

* Sanyos and Nokias have this problem too, but the Sony doesn't really handle the case of
  multiple directory entries with the same phone number. When called by someone
  at a number that for which I have multiple entries, I'd really like to see a list of
  all of the entries containing that number. (This would help handle the case of
  two people each with cell phones and with one home number.)

* The incoming call logs are by number, not by call. This makes it difficult to 
  tell when you've missed multiple calls from the same number.

* The incoming call logs rely on automatic horizontal scrolling to reveal information
  like time of call and number of calls missed. This means that you have to select
  a log entry and sit on it for a few seconds while the phone scrolls the information
  you want into view. I'd much rather have some kind of details/summary view toggle
  button on the side of the phone. Of the <b>four</b> side mounted buttons, surely
  one could be for this.

* There's a music editor built in that lets you compose custom ring tones. However,
  it only lets you work with a fixed set of clips, so it loses its appeal very quickly.
  
I guess that looks like a lot of complaining, but otherwise the phone
is very nice. The last phone I've liked as much is my old Nokia 8260
(and the 6160 before that). The Sanyo 4900 doesn't even come
close. I'm happy enough with this phone to consider buying another
Sony Ericsson. (The new <a

W800i</a> looks pretty nice...)
