title: Small Computing History Resources
date: 2018-12-21

I've lately run across several interesting small computer history
sites. If you have any interest in small computing's emergence from
1980 to 1990 or so, these are worth a look.

In no particular order:

* [OS/2 Museum](http://www.os2museum.com/wp/) - Covers OS/2, but also
  gets into detail around PC architecture. Among other interesting bits,
  this is just one of several articles on
  [A20 gate handling](http://www.os2museum.com/wp/the-a20-gate-fallout/), and
  here's [something](http://www.os2museum.com/wp/the-8514a-graphics-accelerator/)
  on the [IBM 8514/A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_8514).

* [DTACK Grounded](http://www.easy68k.com/paulrsm/dg/) - A newsletter
  written to promote Hal Hardbergh's side business of attached
  [Motorola 68000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000)
  processor boards. Mostly interesting for his commentary on
  then-crurent events leading up to the emergence and use of 32-bit
  microprocessors. Notably, this was written at the time of Intel's 
  pivot from the [iAPX 432](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_iAPX_432)
  to the [80386](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80386). The commentary
  on the relative unreliability of DRAM is amusing too.

* [CRPG Addict](http://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/) - Not sure how he has
  the time, but the author of this blog has set himself the challenge
  of playing through and documenting every early CRPG game from the
  late 70's and well into the 90's.
  
* [The Digital Antiquarian](https://www.filfre.net/) - Critical
  commentary on early small computer gaming. Lots of details about
  how games came to be made and their content.

* [Retrocomputing Stack Exchange site](https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/) -
  This is currently more like Netflix than anything else. Coverage is spotty, but
  that doesn't mean you can't find something interesting to read.
