I saw a <a href="http://www.icefox.net/articles/kdeosx.php">list of
nine things KDE can learn from MacOS X</a> over on <a href="http://planetkde.org">
Planet KDE</a>. This should go beyond OS X, most modern software could stand to
follow this advise. <i>(I'm a big fan of Item 2, single toolbars, and Item 3, 
simple default views. Toolbars got way too complicated around the time Microsoft
introduced Word 6.0, and simple default views make sense for the simple reason
that users should have to explicitly ask for more complex or confusing 
functionality).</i>
