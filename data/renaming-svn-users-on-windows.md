title: Renaming SVN Users on Windows

The instructions I gave earlier on <a 
href="http://www.mschaef.com/blog/tech/programming/renaming-svn-users.html">Renaming 
SVN Users</a> work only when the SVN repository is hosted on a machine that can run 
SVN hooks written in Unix style shell script. On a conventional Windows machine, one 
without Cygwin, MSYS, or similar, you have to switch to writing hooks in something 
like Windows batch language. 

<br><br>

If all you want to do is temporarily rename users, then you can just create an empty 
file named <tt>pre-revprop-change.cmd</tt> in your repository under <tt>hooks\</tt>. 
The default return code from a batch file is success, which SVN interprets as a 
<b>all</b> revision 
property changes, all the time, by anybody. If you want to implement an actual policy, 
Philibert Pérusse has posted a <a
