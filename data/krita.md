Reading <a href="http://cyrilleberger.blogspot.com/">Cyrille Berger's</a> 
blog has been quite interesting lately.  He's been slowly plugging away at 
adding features to <a href="http://www.koffice.org/krita/">Krita</a>, <a 
href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a>'s graphics editor.  Krita now has 16-bit 
color, HDR images, CMYK color space, as well as LAB color. This is stuff
that <a href="http://www.gimp.org">Gimp</a> won't do until <a 
href="http://www.gegl.org/">GEGL</a> is ready and integrated. Maybe it's 
time to start dual booting Linux again...
