I'm sorry I had to write that title: I just ran across a dialog box even
worse than the <a href="http://www.mschaef.com/cgi-bin/my_blosxom.cgi/tech/general/the_abominable_dialog_box.txt">
abominable dialog box</a>.  I now humbly present the 'even more abominable dialog box':

This dialog box improves on the last by shortening the time you have
to save your work from five minutes to one. It also removes the
ability to defer the system restart: you have to restart <b>now</b>.
Sadly, it loses abominibility points because it actually tells you
what's wrong, but face it, who exactly knows what the 'DCOM Server
Process Launcher' does, exactly?  Sure, I can make an educated guess,
but I'm a geek and have been using and programming on Windows machines
for 15 years. If anybody from Microsoft is reading this, let me make
this crystal clear: <b>I DO NOT CARE HOW IMPORTANT YOU THINK
RESTARTING MY SYSTEM IS: MY WORK IS MORE IMPORTANT. I DO NOT CARE HOW
UNSTABLE MY MACHINE BECOMES: I CAN DEAL WITH IT AND RESTART IT
MYSELF. I LIVED THROUGH DOS 4.0, WINDOWS 2.11 and WINDOWS 3.0, TRUST
ME ON THIS. LET ME KNOW WHAT THE DRATTED PROBLEM IS AND LET ME DECIDE
WHEN I NEED TO RESTART. PLEASE!!!!!!!!</b>

Seriously, even if Linux were the $300 closed-source monopolistic OS
and Windows XP was the free, open-source alternative, I'd be seriously
considering switching away from Windows.

Oh, and of course Acrobat reader had to get the last word in. After
the restart induced by the last dialog box, I got this:
