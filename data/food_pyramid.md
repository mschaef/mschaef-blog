I don't usually write posts for the sole purpose of linking to other
posts, but this is an exception. <a

is brilliant. What it is is the <a
href="http://www.mypyramid.gov/">USDA's Food Pyramid</a> but adapted to
how programmers should spend their time.  My one complaint is that
it's way too focused on coding.  My experience has been that it really
pays to spend time on design work and learning to how to better
interact with others, be they clients or team-mates. If you can design
your way out of a rewrite, or work with your client to recast
requirements to save complexity, it can be far more cost effective
than even the best raw code.
