It's hard to believe that it's been six years since people were buying
out stocks of portable generators and predicting the end of the
civilized world. Still, there it is. One of the more interesting
theories I've heard about the long term impacts of the Y2K scare is
presented by Thomas Friedman in his book <i><a
href="http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/worldisflat.htm">The World is
Flat</a></i>. In it, he describes Y2K as one of the ways Indian
software houses first established themselves as a credible way to
develop software.  If that's true, then maybe there's an element of
truth to what the Y2K 'doomsayers' were claiming six years
ago. However, rather than the end of the civilized world, Y2K might
have just signaled the beginning of the decline of pure software
development as a viable American middle class career.


On a lighter note, every new year needs resolutions, and here are those 
of mine that are appropriate to this weblog.

* More posts. Better Content.
* The blog needs a few more features. Namely, it needs a way to
  look at historical posts, as well as a way to post comments
  or send feedback.
* There will be a release of a new version of vCalc this year.
* There will be a release of a new version of NoiseMaker this year.
