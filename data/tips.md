I don't know who this person is, but they have a good 
collection of <a href="http://users.bestweb.net/~ctips/">programming</a>
tips online. A lot of this stuff looks pretty relevant.

<br><br>

Related to that is <a href="http://www.norvig.com/luv-slides.ps">this
deck of slides</a> written by <a href="http://www.nhplace.com/kent/">Kent Pitman</a>
and <a href="http://www.norvig.com/">Peter Norvig</a>. It's an excellent
discussion of good programming style in Lisp.
