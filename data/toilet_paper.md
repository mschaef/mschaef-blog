title: Toilet paper protocol

I have a small proposal to combat the problem of public toilet
stalls without toilet paper. If you notice that a stall is missing
toilet paper, take a reasonable amount from an adjacent stall and
put it atop the toilet paper dispenser in the stall missing
the paper. This does two things: first it signals that the
stall is missing paper. For those unfortunate enough to use the stall
without noticing, it provides a source of backup paper that can
be replenished after use. Either way, it avoids the case of 
somebody using a stall, needing toilet paper, and then finding
themselves without.

Of course, this does not handle the case when all of the stalls
in a restroom have run out. It also doesn't handle the similar
case of a one stall restroom. To handle these special cases, 
a refinement of the protocol would be to have the person that 
consumes the last bit of toilet paper reserve a small amount
at the end of the roll to act as the signal piece.  To maintain
the signal, this piece would have to remain unused, which means
that toilet stall customers would have to be more careful to avoid
using stalls that are out of paper.  After all, they could use
the signalling piece of paper, but that would eliminate the signal
for the next person. On the other hand, the signalling piece
of paper could now be made significantly smaller than it was
in the first version of the protocol, when it was able to be
used.

Some people think about world peace, some think about curing
cancer, I apparantly think about this...
