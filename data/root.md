title: General posts on a topic don't go at the root...

Maybe this should have been obvious from the beginning, but I'm no
longer putting "general interest" blog posts at the root for the
topic. Rather, those posts are now going under a "general" subtopic of
the root.

The problem with making general interest posts at the root of a topic
is that there's then no way to watch only the general topics. If you
look at the root topic, you get the whole topic.
