Heh... saw some quotes on <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>
referring to Commodore's marketing of the old Amiga. I thought they were
funny enough to share here:

> If Commodore bought KFC they would have changed the name to "Warm dead birds in a paper bucket".

> Commodore Sushi: Cold, dead, raw fish.

I have no idea what the attribution should be for these.
