One interest of mine is programming languages, and more
specifically, Lisp and Scheme. Lately, the blogosphere
has produced a couple interesting blogs that tie to
this interest:
<p><p>
<list>
<li><a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/">Lambda the Ultimate</a>
<li><a href="http://planet.lisp.org/">Planet Lisp</a>
</list>
<p><p>
Planet Lisp aggregates a bunch of Lisp-related blogs, while LtU is more
general and more of a discussion site.

Related, I came to LtU via <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ericlippert">Eric
Lippert's Blog</a> over on <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net">Weblogs @ASP.Net</a>.
Eric is a developer at Microsoft who's done a lot of work on Windows scripting
and the Windows script languages.
