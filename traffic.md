Blog readership on this blog is very low.  I'd go so far as to say
that I'm the only person that regularly hits it, and that's usually to
test layout, formatting, etc.

To make it easier to distinguish traffic from me, and traffic from
other folks, I've added a symlink to my configuration that makes it
possible to hit the blog from a different, private, URL. That way, my
hits and other folks hits are nicely bucketed out in my ISP's
reporting. This is a cheap and easy solution, and I reccomend it.
