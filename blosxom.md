I've spent a little time doing some things to tweak Bloxsom
so that it fits better into my website. So far, I've:
<p>
<list>
<li>Changed the html flavour to refer to my CSS file and use it correctly.
<li>Set up a simple hierarchy of post topics.
<li>Gotten static rendering working (as a test, it's not in use now.)
</list>
<p>
None of this is all that earth shattering, but it was all trivial
to do in Bloxsom. For a one-file, 16K Perl script, Bloxsom  brings
a lot to the table.

Next on the adgenda is getting a web form set up for posting and
hopefully editing blog posts, and then setting up a web-based
way to upload images into the blog. My current workflow for posting
to the blog involves two levels of nested SSH logins and the use
of vi. *shudder*.
