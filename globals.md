Global variables tend get a bad rap, kind of like goto and pointers.
Personally, I think they can be pretty useful if you are careful.
Here are the guidelines I use to determine if a global variable
is an appropriate solution:

* Will there ever be a need for more than one instance of the variable? 
* How much complexity does passing the variable to all its accessors entail? 
* Does the variable represent global state? (A heap free list, configuration information, a pool of threads, a global mutex, etc.) 
* Can the data be more effectively modeled as a static variable in a function or private member variable in a singleton object? <i>(Both of these are other forms of global storage, but they wrap the variable accesses in accessor functions.)</i>
* Can you support the lifecycle you need for the variable any other way? Global variables exist for the duration of your program's run-time. Local variables exist for the duration of a function. If you don't have heap allocated variables, or if your heap allocator sucks, then a global variable might be the best way to get to storage that lasts longer than any one function invocation.
* Do you need to use environment features that are specific to globals? In MSVC++, this can mean things like <a href="http://www.thecodeproject.com/dll/data_seg_share.asp"> specifying the segment in which a global is stored</a> or declaring a variable as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vclang/html/_pluslang_the_thread_attribute.asp">thread-local</a>. 

If all that leads you to the decision that a global variable is the
best choice, you can then take steps to mitigate some of the risks
involved.  The first thing i'd do is prefix global variable names with
a unique qualifier, maybe something like g_.  This lowers the risk of
namespace collisions as well as clearely denotes what variables are
global, when you have to read or alter your code. If you have multiple
global variables, I'd also be tempted to wrap them all up in a
structure, for some of the same reasons.
